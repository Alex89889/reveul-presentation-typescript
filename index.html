						<p>You’ve probably already heard the word “TypeScript” before.In 2018, TypeScript was the <b>7th most-used and the 3rd fastest-growing language on GitHub</b>, with over <b>5 million weekly downloads of its compiler</b>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
						<p>TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft that compiles to JavaScript.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#8f5177">
					<h2>Who created it and why?</h2>
					<p>TypeScript was <b>created by Microsoft</b> and was <b>released in 2012</b> after two years of development. It was created to allow for optional static type checking, which would be particularly useful when developing large scale applications.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#8f5177">

						<h2> How is TypeScript different from JavaScript?</h2>
						<p>The most important difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is that they are <b>two separate programming languages, though TypeScript is heavily based on JavaScript</b>. In fact, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<p><b>Everything that can be written in JavaScript can also be written in TypeScript:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>frontend in any framework,</li>
							<li>backend in Node.js,</li>
							<li>cross-platform mobile apps in React Native.</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>How does TypeScript improve JavaScript?</h2>
					<p><b>The key augmentation TypeScript brings to JavaScript is a type system</b> (hence the name “TypeScript”).</p>
				  </section>
				  <section>	
					<p>Traditionally, JavaScript is <b>dynamically</b> typed (much like Python). This means that a single variable can either contain text, a number, or even a whole database entity, depending on the occasion—and that’s just fine. <b>What TypeScript does is strictly define what a given variable can contain.</b></p>
				  </section>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#8f5177">
				  <section>
					<h2>Advantages of TypeScript</h2>
					<p>Going into greater technical detail, TypeScript gives you:<p>
					<p><b>1. Strict typing</b></p>
					<p>Everything stays the way we define it. Need a variable to always be a number? It’ll always be a number, then.</p>
				  </section>
				  <section>
					<p><b>2. Structural typing</b></p>
					<p>Indispensable when you care about fully defining the actual structure you use. JavaScript allows for a lot of strange things to be done, so relying on a specific structure is a much safer solution.</p>
					<p><b>3. Type annotations</b></p>
					<p>A handy way of saying explicitly what type should be used.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><b>4. Type inference</b></p>
					<p>Implicit typing performed by TypeScript itself, so that your developers don’t need to provide types where the compiler can find them on its own.</p>
				</section>
				</section>

						<h2>Additional features of TypeScript</h2>
						<p><b>TypeScript introduced a great deal of syntax taken from object-oriented programming, including but not limited to:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>interfaces</li>
							<li>classes</li>
							<li>enumerated types</li>
							<li>generics</li>
							<li>modules</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It’s true that ECMAScript 6 (or ECMAScript 2015) introduced some of those features to JavaScript—but not all of them. For instance, <b>abstract classes or access modifiers are still nowhere to be found in JavaScript, while TypeScript has them.</b></p>
						<p>And the best part of being a superset of JavaScript? <b>Every new JavaScript feature is also a new TypeScript feature.</b></p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#8f5177">
					<h3>TypeScript is popular and trusted by the biggest players in the industry</h3>
					<p>The language is widely used in software products such as <b>Slack, Asana, or Visual Studio Code</b>. What’s more, many great JavaScript tools are written in TypeScript, including frameworks (Angular, Aurelia, or Ionic) and libraries (ZoomCharts, yWorks, or GoJS).</p>

						<h2>What are some alternatives to TypeScript?</h2>
						<p>1.<b>Flow</b>is also a superset of JavaScript, but it isn’t categorized as a separate language. Like TypeScript, Flow offers type annotations… and that’s pretty much it. No additional syntax, everything is the same as in JavaScript.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>2. <b>JSDoc</b> is a living standard for documenting JavaScript code. It allows you to not only use text to write what each piece of code is doing, but also annotate types.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>3. <b>Kotlin</b> has an official JavaScript compilation solution.</p>
						<p>4 .<b>Rust</b> may work on the frontend; however, it doesn’t compile directly to JavaScript, but rather WebAssembly. </p>
					</section>
						
					<section>
						<p>5. <b>Go</b> can be effectively compiled either to JavaScript—via an unofficial tool called GopherJS—or to WebAssembly, much like Rust.</p>
						<p>6. <b>Elm</b> and <b>Reason</b> were designed for JavaScript compilation.</p>
